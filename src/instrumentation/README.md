The functions in this folder are getting called on every server startup, they setup our custom DB functions and views
The file which contains the call back function is /src/insturmentation.ts
Docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation
This file will setup our DB

1. `initExportFunctions(exportApiIdentifier)`
   Create the PostgreSQL functions that are used by the export API in `src/pages/api/export/[tableName].ts`
2. `initVerificationViews(verificationApiIdentifier)`
   Create the post commit hook, tables and indexes that are required for our verification feature.

Note: here exists a cross dependency between the front- and backend.
This requires that the backend allways completes the processing before we start the frontend, otherwise we might miss some tables that we require in the view or function creation.
