All `.poly` files in `./regions` are used in `run-2-filter.sh` to reduce the pbf file of Germany to only those regions we are supporting right now.

We switched from `.geojson` to `.poly` because joining two poly files is trivial (just concat the files) and thus allows a single run extract which is significantly faster.

To convert `.geojson` files to the `.poly` format we use the command line tool [geojson2poly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geojson2poly):

```
npx geojson2poly app/filter/regions/geojson/lueneburg.geojson app/filter/regions/lueneburg.poly
