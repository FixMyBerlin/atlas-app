# Coding conventions for `/process`

- Each folder specified in the `topics` list in [`run-5-process.sh`](../run-5-process.sh) is a run task
- Each folder must have one `/app/process/<topic>/<topic>.lua` file
- Each folder may have one `/app/process/<topic>/<topic>.sql` file

See also ["Processing: Run changes only"](../../README.md#processing-run-changes-only)

## TODO

Rename `/app` to `/processing` and `/app/process` to `/processing/topics`
