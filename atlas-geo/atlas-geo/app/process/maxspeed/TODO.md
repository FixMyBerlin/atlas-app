# `maxspeed:conditional`

We could try to parse `maxspeed:conditional`. However, ATM we show the raw tag in our UI which is good enough for now.

# `traffic_sign`

We could try to parse `traffic_sign` values related to maxspeed. However, those are rarely tagged and maxspeed is tagged a lot more.

# Todo debug info

- We could look for missmatch of zone\* and maxspeed values to cleanup the data.
- We could look for missmatch of traffic_sign and maxspeed values to cleanup the data.
- We could add todo notes if source is sign but no traffic_sign tag is given.
