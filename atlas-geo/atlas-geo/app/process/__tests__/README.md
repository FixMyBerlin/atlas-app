# Unit tests

## Conventions

- Create one test file per helper
- Filename has to be `\*.test.lua`
- Place it in a `__tests__` folder next to the file

## Run

From the root of this file repo, run `npm run test` to run all `*.test.lua` files inside the Docker container.

See the code comments in the two `run-tests.sh` files to learn more about what they do.
