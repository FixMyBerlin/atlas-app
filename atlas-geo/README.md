## About

This project handles the processing of geo data for [`atlas-app`](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/atlas-app).
The data is selected and optimize to make planning of bicycle infrastructure easier.

`atlas-geo` will download, filter and process OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS Database and make them available as vector tiles with [`martin`](https://github.com/maplibre/martin).

## Issues

Please use [`atlas-app`](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/atlas-app/issues) to create issues for this repository.

## Server

- Production Tiles https://tiles.radverkehrsatlas.de/
- Staging Tiles https://staging-tiles.radverkehrsatlas.de/
- Development Tiles http://localhost:7800/

## Data

### Freshness of source data

We use the [public Germany export from Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany.html) `<3` which includes OSM Data up until ~20:00 h of the previous day. All processing is done on this dataset.

### Freshness of processed data

- Data is processed every day ([cron job definition](/.github/workflows/generate-tiles.yml#L3-L6))
- Data is processed on every deploy/release
- Data can be processed manually [via Github Actions ("Run workflow > from Branch: `main`")](https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/atlas-geo/actions/workflows/generate-tiles.yml).

### Deployment

1. First https://github.com/FixMyBerlin/atlas-geo/actions runs.
2. Server (IONOS) runs the processing one table at a time.
   The whole processing takes about 1.5 h. See [`run.sh`](processing/run.sh) for details.

**Skip CI Actions:**

ATM, the CI runs on every commit. To skip commits add `[skip actions]` to the commit message. This is a [default behaviour](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs) of Github Actions.

## Development

### Initial setup

1. First create a `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.
2. Follow "Run the whole system"

### Run the whole system

The workflow isâ€¦

1. Edit the files locally

2. Rebuild and restart everything
   ```sh
   docker compose build && docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Inspect the new results, see "Inspect changes"

> **Note**
> Learn more about the file/folder-structure and coding patterns in [`processing/topics/README.md`](/processing/topics/README.md)

### Processing: Run changes only

Whenever `SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` is active we store a hash of all `.lua` and `.sql` per folder.
During [`run-5-process.sh`](processing/run-5-process.sh) we only run code if the hash has changed.
If any helper in (`topics/helper`)[processing/topics/helper] changed, we rerun everything.

Whenever we talk about `hash`es in this code, this feature is referenced.

**Force rerun:** Whenever you need to force a rerun, open [any lua helper](./processing/topics/helper/Set.lua) and add a temporary code comment, save and restart the processing.

### Processing: Inspect changes

Whenever `SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` and `COMPUTE_DIFFS=1`, the system will create `<tablename>_diff` tables that contain only changed entries.

It will compare the `tags` column to the previous run.

The settings are the default for development but disabled on staging, production by default.

Whenever we talk about `diff`s in this code, this feature is referenced.

### Process only a single object

For the development process it's often usefull to run the processing on a single object.
For that you can specify an id (list) as `ID_FILTER` in the [`processing/run-3-filter.sh`](/processing/run-3-filter.sh).
See the [osmium-docs](https://docs.osmcode.org/osmium/latest/osmium-getid.html) for more information.
