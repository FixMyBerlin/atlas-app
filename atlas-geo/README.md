# tarmac-geo ‚Äì custom vector tiles for bike infrastructure planning based on OpenStreetMap

## About

This project will download, filter and process OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS Database and make them available as vector tiles with pg_tileserve.

The data we process is selected and optimize to make planning of bicycle infrastructure easier.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup

First create a `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

```sh
docker compose up
```

This will create the docker container and run all scripts. One this is finished, you can use the pg_tileserve-vector-tile-preview at http://localhost:7800/ to look at the data.

_Notes:_
- We use a custom build for `postgis` in [db.Dockerfile] to support Apple ARM64

## üí™ Work

You can only rebuild and regenerate the whole system, for now. The workflow is‚Ä¶

1. Edit the files locally

2. Rebuild and restart everything
    ```sh
    docker compose build && docker compose up
    ```

3. Inspect the new results

**TODOs**

- [ ] Allow editing code direclty inside the docker container, so no rebuild is needed; change the re-generation-part
- [ ] Split of the downloading of new data

**Notes**

Hack into the bash
```sh
docker compose exec app bash
```

You can also run the script locally:

1. This requires a new user in postgres which is the same as your current user:
    ```sh
    sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER; sudo -u postgres createdb $USER
    ```
2. Then copy the [configuration file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html) `./config/pg_service.conf` to `~/.pg_service.conf` and adapt your username and remove the password.

**Build & Run only one container**
Build docker
```sh
docker build -f app.Dockerfile -t tarmac:latest .
```

Run it
```sh
docker run --name mypipeline -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d tarmac
```

Hack into the bash
```sh
docker exec -it mypipeline bash
```


## OSM Data extraction

The OSM data will be automatically downloaded from download.geofabrik.de.
It is also possible to extract even smaller areas with osmium. For this you need the relation id from OSM for a multipolygon.

Then you can run, for example:
```sh
osmium extract -p bb-boundary.osm stuttgart-regbez-latest.osm.pbf -o bietigheim-bissingen.pbf
```
