# Dataset `roadClassification`

## Main values

`category` holds the value of the OSM `highway` tag â€¦ with a few exceptions:

- `highway=road` becomes `category=unspecified_road_category`
- `highway=service + service=*` becomes `category=service_unspecified`
- `highway=service + service=alley` becomes `category=service_alley`
- `highway=service + service=driveway` becomes `category=service_driveway`
- `highway=service + service=parking_aisle` becomes `category=service_parking_aisle`
- `highway=* + bicycle_road=yes` becomes `category=bicycle_road`
- `highway=steps` becomes `category=footway`

## Notes / TODOs

- We could improve the `*crossing` categories
- We could add special tags for streets only for bus, tax, etc.
  (we would probably have to look at the `*lanes` schema for that)
