- `highway=service + service=alley` becomes `category=service_alley`
- `highway=service + service=driveway` becomes `category=service_driveway`
- `highway=service + service=parking_aisle` becomes `category=service_parking_aisle`
- `highway=* + bicycle_road=yes` becomes `category=bicycle_road`
- `highway=steps` becomes `category=footway`
