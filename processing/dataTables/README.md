# About

We have a schema `data` that holds external datasets for special purpose processing that requires the data to be in the database.
All static, external data is handled by the "static data" tooling in tilda-geo.

## Examples

**Mapillary Coverage Data**

We store this data manually but join it to our daily processed data during the SQL part of our processing.
