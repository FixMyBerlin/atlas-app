-- TASK: Move `bikelanes` based on `offset`
-- ====================
-- 1. Project to cartesian coordinates
-- 2. Move the geometry by `offset` (+ left / - right)
--    Because negative offsets reverse the order and we want the right side to be aligned we reverse the order again
--    Additionally we check wether the geometry is `simple` because otherwise we might get a MLString
--    for the same reason we simplify the geometries
--
-- Ideas for improvements:
-- IDEA 1: maybe we can transform closed geometries with some sort of buffer function:
--   at least for the cases where we buffer "outside"(side=right) this should always yield a LineString
-- IDEA 2: scale around center of geom (would require to estimate the scaling factor)
--   Query below shows the geometries that would result in MultiLineString
-- SELECT * from "bikelanes" WHERE not ST_IsSimple(geom) or ST_IsClosed(geom);

  geom = ST_Transform (
    ST_OffsetCurve (
      ST_Simplify (ST_Transform (geom, 25833), 0.5),

-- TASK: Cleanup duplicate `todos_lines`
-- ====================
-- Our process creates duplicated entries whenever encounter a transformed geometry.
-- Those results have identical tags, except for the `id` which has a `/left` or `/right` postfix.
-- It's very complex to skip those duplications during line-by-line processing, due to the complexity of `cycleway`|`cycleway:SIDE`
-- Our workaround is, to remove all identical lines except for one, which is what this script does.
