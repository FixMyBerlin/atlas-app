- This is LUA embedded into osm2pgsql.
  - That means we have access to a few helpers from https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#lua-library-for-flex-output.
  - There is also the special `osm2pgsql` class that we use all over which is documented at https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html.
- We have helper libraries installed which can be found in [processing.Dockerfile](../processing.Dockerfile)
  - Use those rather than create helper functions from scratch.
  - `busted` is our testing framework https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/
  - `inspect` is to print / inspect tables https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua â€” our own helper around that is called `Log(object, 'logging prefix')`
  - `penlight` is to add python like helpers to lua https://lunarmodules.github.io/Penlight/
  - We can add more helpers if this makes our code cleaner; make a suggestion if that applies.
- We use camel_case for our file names and functions and variables.
  - However, there are legacy functions that are still using MixedCase. Don't change this during an unrelated edit.
  - Our linter does not accept lower case global functions but we ignore that because we cannot configure the linter properly.
- Each file has to start with a `require('init')` which will make all `package.path` avaiable so we don't have to require those manually.
- To require a function, used to put everything in the global namespace like `require("function_name")` the file and then use `function_name`. But for new helper methods, we return from the helper file and require via  `local function_name = require("function_name")`.
- Preserve code comments that are still relevant.

Software tests:
- Are always in a `__tests__` folder in the same directory or one directory up.
- They need to have a name like `file_name_of_functions.test.lua`. So the same name as the file that is being tested postfixed with ".test".
- They use busted internally but that is automatically loaded and does not need to be required.
- Use `require("foo")` to load the function that is being tested.
- Always add `require('Log')` and `require('init')`
- To run the test, to got `./` and run `./processing/run-tests.sh`

Formatting:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
